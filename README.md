This assignment is based on the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set available from
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
The R script run_analysis.R creates a tidy data set that combines the training and test groups
into one dataset for analysis. It also summarizes the data, computing means by activity and subject
for each of the mean and standard deviation measures.
